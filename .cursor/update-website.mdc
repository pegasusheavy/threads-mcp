After completing any significant feature, update, or change to the project, update the relevant documentation on the GitHub Pages website (docs/ directory) to reflect the changes. This includes:

- Updating the main timeline (index.html) with new feature announcements as thread posts
- Adding new versions to changelog.html with detailed change notes
- Updating any affected documentation pages (API.md, EXAMPLES.md, etc.)
- Ensuring the website accurately represents the current state of the project

Always commit and push website updates along with the code changes.
